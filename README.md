# odin-testing-practice

This project was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum completion. It involved developing several function/modules using Test Driven Development methodology. Jest testing framework was used throughout the developemnt, which provides simple interface for creaing and running tests inside the environment. 

All developed functions/modules reside in `src/functions`, while all Jest testing files reside in `src/tests`.
